                        <p class="team-title">Global PE & AI Leadership</p>
                        <p class="team-role">Managing & General Partner</p>
                        <div class="team-description-container">
                            <p class="team-description">Chris Morino is the Founder and Managing Partner of Prytaneum Partners, a private equity platform built to acquire and revive underperforming B2B software businesses through disciplined operations, strong governance, and a cash-first operating philosophy.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris's career has been shaped inside complex operating environments where outcomes were measured not in projections, but in customer retention, margin recovery, and execution under pressure. In prior senior operating roles, he led and operated multi-company software portfolios generating more than $130 million in annual revenue, and delivering sustained net operating margins ranging from approximately 75% to over 84% across complex, distressed software portfolios following periods of instability or underperformance.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">These results ranked in the top tier of global software operating benchmarks relative to comparable private-equity-owned portfolios, reflecting disciplined execution rather than leverage, multiple expansion, or transient cost suppression.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Across these environments, his mandate was consistent: stabilize operations, restore accountability, and reorient organizations around cash discipline, margin integrity, and customer value. While starting conditions varied, the sequencing of action did not—clarity before growth, governance before scale, and operating discipline before capital deployment.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Importantly, this level of performance was not the result of individual heroics. It reflected a repeatable operating culture built on disciplined teams, explicit accountability, and execution within well-defined governance constraints.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris is consistently described as calm under pressure and execution-first in leadership style, favoring clarity over charisma, cadence over urgency, and outcomes over optics. Decisions are shared before execution, ownership is explicit, and systems are designed so performance does not depend on any single individual. This leadership approach has proven durable in post-acquisition environments where timelines are compressed and errors compound quickly.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Chris has designed his operating approach around artificial intelligence from first principles rather than adopting it as a layer on top of legacy processes. AI is embedded into how work is performed across diligence, governance, operating diagnostics, and execution, so that every material task is built for automation and analytical leverage from the outset. This design eliminates low-value manual work, applies accumulated institutional knowledge continuously, and compresses analytical and execution timelines by an order of magnitude. Speed, in this context, is a consequence of system architecture and judgment discipline—human operators retain full authority and accountability, with AI expanding decision quality rather than replacing it.</p>
                            <p class="team-description">Prytaneum inherits this operating culture directly. The platform is a formal extension of Chris's prior execution experience, deliberately structured for investors who prioritize capital protection, early cash yield, and predictable behavior over growth-at-any-cost strategies. Chris's role is not to speculate on outcomes, but to design and install systems capable of producing them at scale.</p>
